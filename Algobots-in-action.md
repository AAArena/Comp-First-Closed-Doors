# Watching Algobots in Action

Now that you have a working version of your t-bot and have set it to perform some back testing or live trades, you can use the [AAWeb]( http://aawebplatformalpha.azurewebsites.net/) app to visualize your algobot's actions on a candlestick chart. Being able to visually review your t-bot's trades is an essential part of the optimization process as it may help you fine-tune your t-bot's decision-making.

## AAWeb Overview

[AAWeb]( http://aawebplatformalpha.azurewebsites.net/) is an HTML canvas featuring three overlaid _visual spaces_ working simultaneously:

* **Charts Timeline**: It is a timeline in which algobots' products are displayed in a graphical representation created by plotters.

* **Floating Notifications**: It is a layer of information displayed on top the timeline, typically containing t-bots' related information such as t-bots' runtime position and messages.

* **Control & Information Panels**: There are two types of panels. One set of panels is built in the AAWeb and show certain control elements to dictate what exactly is shown on the timeline (time control features and a list of algobots products, for instance). A second type of panels is created by plotters to display additional information for certain products.

**References**:

_Charts Timeline_:

1. This is the Charts Timeline. Notice the background watermark indicating this is the USDT-BTC market.

2. The right margin features the Price Scale, in this case denominated in USDT.

3. The left margin features a Percent Scale that is used in Algobots Competitions to indicate ROI.

4. This is the candlestick chart visually showing Olivia's products, generated by [Plotters-Candles-Volumes](https://github.com/AAMasters/Plotters-Candles-Volumes).

_Floating Notifications_:

5. This is a message left by a t-bot, commenting on the nature of the operation being performed. The message is linked to a specific point in time.

6. This is an icon indicating the last execution of a certain t-bot.

_Control & Information Panels_:

7. This is the Algobots Products Panel featuring products of algobots registered on the [AAPlatform ecosystem.json]( https://github.com/AdvancedAlgos/AAPlatform/blob/master/ecosystem.json) configuration file.

8. This is the Time Control Panel, featuring controls for navigating the candles in either direction.

9. This is the Current Candle Panel providing additional information about the candle filled in yellow in the candlestick chart. This panel is too generated by the [Plotters-Candles-Volumes](https://github.com/AAMasters/Plotters-Candles-Volumes) used by Olivia to help visualize her products.

10. This is the Current Volume Panel, which works pretty much like the Current Candle Panel.

## Navigating Through the Charts Timeline

With your mouse:

* Zoom in and out by turning the wheel forwards and blackguards respectively. Notice how the time scale is automatically adjusted for different levels of zoom. The timescale is represented by the actual candles and the time value of each candle is indicated in the Time Control Panel.

* Click and drag to pan across the timeline.

By default, the timeline is paused. The buttons in the Time Control Panel allow you to walk through the timeline in different ways:

* The buttons immediately on either side of the pause button scroll the timeline horizontally in increments of one candlestick, either left or rightwards.

* The play buttons play the timeline forwards or backwards continuously.

* The remaining buttons fast forwards and backwards respectively.

* The text displayed above the control buttons indicate datetime and timescale of the current candle.

## Algobots Products Panel

Use the Algobots Products Panel to turn ON and OFF layers –including candlesticks, volumes, indicators and studies– by clicking on the radio buttons on the right. A green light means the layer is showing in the charts. A yellow light means the layer is being calculated and made available to dependent layers. A red light means the layer is not calculated, thus not showing.

> **Known Issue**: The Algobots Products Panel is not scrollable yet. This is unfortunate, of course, but there is a workaround that allows seeing products further down the list. You need to zoom out at the browser level (CTRL + backwards turn of the mouse wheel). This action will shrink the panel along with everything else. Once it is shrunk, refresh (F5) the page. The timeline will reload using all the screen space but the panels will remain shrunk.

## T-Bots in Action

When either of the trading products is _on_ in the Algobots Products Panel, the [Plotters-Trading]( https://github.com/AAMasters/Plotters-Trading) associated with t-bots renders a number of visual clues in the timeline to indicate various t-bot actions. Notice the small triangles two candles after the current candle in solid yellow:

* A triangle pointing downwards represents a _sell order_. 

  * When the triangle is transparent with a red outline, it represents the moment in time and price point in which the order was placed.

  * When the triangle is solid red, it represents the moment in time and price point in which the order was filled.

* Similarly, a triangle pointing upwards with a green outline means a _buy order_ was placed and the solid green triangle indicates that the order was filled.

> Notice that outlined and solid triangles may overlap if the zoom level does not allow rendering each triangle in separate candles. In that case, it means that the order was placed and filled during the period of time represented by the candle.

## Action in a Competition Setting

Competition related events are –too– rendered over the timeline. A thin red vertical line marks the start of the competition and a checkered vertical banner marks the end of the competition.

T-Bots keep showing their trades on the candlestick charts, as usual. In addition, a new area of the timeline gains relevance: the intersection of the red vertical line with the 0% horizontal mark of the ROI scale in the left margin. This is exactly where the competition starts.

Trading algobots start out the competition at the 0% mark and their ROI is tracked with every single execution (every one minute) and rendered in the timeline accordingly.

In other words, the competition can be followed in real time simply by watching the timeline.

> **Known Issue**: At this point in time, the head of the market is not refreshed automatically. That means that candles and bot actions are not updated spontaneously, thus the refresh operation needs to be done manually.
