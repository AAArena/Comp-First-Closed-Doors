# Getting Started

## Basic Definitions

### Infrastructure

**Algobots**: Open-source algorithms destined to become autonomous agents with an autonomous financial life once the AAPlatform along with the Algobots Business are launched.

**AAPlatform**: AKA _the platform_, it is the IT system on top of which everything runs.

**AACloud**: The part of the system that runs algobots in the cloud.

**AAWeb**: The part of the system that shows algobots' activities in a visual environment.

**Algobots Arena**: The scenario in which competitions take place.

### Stakeholders

**Advanced Algos Ltd.**: The start up behind the creation of the AAPlatform and the people running this show until the Algobots Community takes over.

**Algobots Community**: The emerging community of developers and traders that share our vision and help push it forwards by creating algobots.

**Algobot Team**: That would be you, along with anyone else that wishes to help you out in this quest.

### Business

**Algobots Business**: A business and economic ecosystem in which all parties described herein will participate once the AAPlatform is released.

## Still Wondering What We Are Doing Here?

In a nut shell, we are bootstrapping a community that collaborates to create the most advanced, accessible and easy-to-use crypto trading algorithms. We compete to push ourselves and adopt open-source development practices and permissionless innovation principles to collaborate and drive the rapid-evolution of algobots.

Advanced Algos Ltd focuses on refining the infrastructure and developing the platform that will eventually allow end-users to hire our collective trading intelligence by subscribing to our trading algobots. The Community develops the actual algobots, has fun and win prizes competing with each other, and collects the profits resulting from each other's real-life crypto trading with our own t-bots.

Together, we are creating a new business in the new sharing economy. A business with fairness and transparency as core values, in which all parties benefit. And –at the same time– a business with a profound social mission: to bring the opportunity of economic progress to all people.
